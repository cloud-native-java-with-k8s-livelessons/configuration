# The Spring Cloud Config Bus

This demonstrates how you can add `spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp` and the `spring-boot-starter-actuator` to the config server and to the various client microservices then invoke the new `/actuator/busrefresh` event, thusly:

```shell
curl localhost:8080/actuator/busrefresh -d {} -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

You can also have the config server respond to changes in the source repositories and trigger the bus event (`RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent`) for you automatically, on the change itself. There are two ways to do this, both involve using the `spring-cloud-config-monitor`. If you're using a local file-ssytem based Git repository, then you only need to make sure that the URL you use for the Spring Cloud Config Server Git URI is a `file://` URL, like this:

```properties
spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri = file:///${HOME}/Desktop/configuration-config
```

If you're using a source code provider like Github or Gitlab, then you need to configure that service to invoke this config-server with a webhook.  The webhook will hit the `/monitor` endpoint with a payload, like this:

```json
 { "path" :  "/Users/jlong/Desktop/configuration"}
```
